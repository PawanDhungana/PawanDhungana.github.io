## About Me
I'm a student currently studying Computer Science at St Cloud State University. I am originally from Nepal, I came to the US after 
high school to pursue higher education. I am very greatful for this virtual intern opportunity because I can be of some help for
changing the face of education for many people and also pursue my career in web development. I am very excited to get started and
I look forward to seeing you all. Thank you!
